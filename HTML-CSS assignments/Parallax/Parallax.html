    <p>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.</p>

        Deer are known for being calm and gentle animals. Many people even think of Bambi, the young and playful Disney cartoon, when they see a deer out in the wild.Deer are often seen slowly eating plants or leaping through the tall grass, and are recognized by their fluffy white tails and big antlers.    </p>

    <p>Elephants are large, majestic animals that have been admired and studied for hundreds of years.
        They are the largest mammal that lives on land and are known for their gentle attitude and intelligence.
        While these elephants don’t have many predators, there is one threat that is quickly endangering them.Elephants belong to the mammal family, which means that they have hair, give birth to live young, and feed their babies milk. They have large, thin ears that are used to help cool them down, and have long, powerful trunks.

    <p>Known as the ‘King of the Jungle’ a lion is certainly one interesting animal. But even though it has this name, it certainly doesn’t live in the jungle…interesting.Cat species are normally quite lonesome characters, but lions however like to hang around in groups, called prides. In their pride there will be females, young lions and a few adult males and there are normally about 10 or 15 in a pride.

        If there’s heaps of food around, a pride can have as many as 30 lions in it. They obviously like to have a good old chat, or roar, to each other. Not sure they’ll be that friendly if we bumped into them though!
