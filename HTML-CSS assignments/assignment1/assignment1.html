        <b> <p style="color: white;">10 Things About Nikola Tesla:</p></b>
        <ul id="box">
            <li class="p1"><b>1844:</b>He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse.</li>
            <li><b>1882-1883:</b> In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor.</li>
            <li class="p1"><b>1884:</b>Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York with four cents in his pocket, to work with Edison</li>
            <li><b>1891:</b>In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.</li>
            <li class="p1"><b>1895:</b>He experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those that later were to be used by Wilhelm Röntgen when he discovered X-rays in 1895.</li>
            <li><b>1898:</b>In 1898 Tesla announced his invention of a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control. When skepticism was voiced, Tesla proved his claims for it before a crowd in Madison Square Garden.</li>
            <li class="p1"><b>1899-1900:</b>Tesla made what he regarded as his most important discovery—terrestrial stationary waves. By this discovery he proved that Earth could be used as a conductor and made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency.</li>
            <li><b>1917:</b>Tesla was the recipient of the Edison Medal in 1917, the highest honour that the American Institute of Electrical Engineers could bestow.</li>
            <li class="p1"> At one time he was certain he had received signals from another planet in his Colorado laboratory, a claim that was met with derision in some scientific journals.</li>
            <li>Caustic criticism greeted his speculations concerning communication with other planets, his assertions that he could split the Earth like an apple, and his claim of having invented a death ray capable of destroying 10,000 airplanes at a distance of 400 km (250 miles).</li>
        </ul>
